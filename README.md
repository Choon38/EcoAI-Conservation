## Project Overview
The EcoAI Conservation Portal aims to raise awareness about endangered species and provide resources for conservation efforts. Our mission is to inspire individuals and communities to take action towards protecting our planet's wildlife through education and sustainable practices. We utilize the **IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature)** dataset to inform our insights and strategies regarding endangered plant and tree species.

## Features
- Information about endangered plant and tree species from the IUCN dataset
- AI-driven insights and recommendations for conservation efforts
- Community engagement through volunteer opportunities and donation options
- Resources for sustainable practices and environmental education

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes a variety of technologies to create an effective and engaging conservation portal. The key technologies used include:

- **HTML:** The foundational markup language used to structure the web pages.
- **CSS (Tailwind CSS):** A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid styling and responsive design, ensuring a visually appealing user interface.
- **JavaScript:** Although not currently implemented, this language is intended for any interactive elements that may be added in the future, enhancing user experience.
- **AI Tools/Frameworks:**
  - **TensorFlow:** An open-source machine learning library that could be used for building and training AI models to analyze data related to endangered species and predict conservation outcomes.

  - **Scikit-learn:** A powerful library for machine learning in Python, used for data analysis and building models to support conservation efforts.
  
These technologies work together to provide a comprehensive platform for raising awareness and promoting conservation efforts for endangered species through the use of artificial intelligence.
